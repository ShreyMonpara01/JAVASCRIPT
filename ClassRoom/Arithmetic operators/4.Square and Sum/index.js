// you have to create three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
// one, two, three
// â€¢ You have to find the square of the three numbers and find the sum of their square values
// Note: The square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9
// input 
// 1 2 3
// output
// 14
// Hint
// In the sample test case, the value stored in one = 1, two = 2, three = 3.
// The square of the values stored will be
// one = 1 * 1 = 1
// two = 2 * 2 = 4
// three = 3 * 3 = 9
// The resultant sum becomes one + two + three = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14, which is the required answer.
// Define the three numbers

// the resultant
let one = 1
let two = 2
let three = 3
// multili one* teo *three
let SquareOne = one * one
let SquareTwo = two * two
let SquareThree = three * three
// sum one* teo *three
let resultant = SquareOne + SquareTwo + SquareThree;

console.log(resultant);
