// var number=4
// You are given a number, stored in a variable with the name number. Perform the following operations on the value stored in the number

// Multiply the value by 3
// Add 7 after it
// Subtract 10 from it


// After performing all the above operations, print the updated value

// sample input 
// 4
// sample output
// 9

// Hint
// In the sample test case, the value stored in the variable number is 4.
// After multiplying the value by 3, the value gets updated to 12
// After that, we add 7 to it, so the number gets updated to 19
// Finally, we subtract 10 from it, so the value becomes 9, which is the final output
let number = 4;

console.log((number * 3) + 7 - 10);
